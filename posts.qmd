### CLEANING DATA IN R

```{r}
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
head(murders) #gives the first 6 row from data set

library(dplyr)
glimpse(murders) #glimpsing of the data set
str(murders) #structure of the data set

is.numeric(murders$population)#if we use assert_is_numeric(murders$state) the output would be"murders$state is not class 'numeric'; it has class chr. (You should install required packages for use assert_is_ functions.)

library(stringr)
revenue_trimmed = str_remove(murders$abb, "A") #if we would like to remove a chr from a string we can use str_remove func.
revenue_trimmed

head(murders %>% mutate(new_column = revenue_trimmed)) #add a new column to a data frame
summary(murders$population) #calculate min, 1st Qu, median, mean, 3rd Qu and max values for the variable.

```
